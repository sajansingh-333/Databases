We will opt for serverless DBs when there is no consistent traffic to DB, 
when the request comes the DB will be Up and request will be processed, 
pricing will be calculated for the time taken to process the request,
when traffic goes down then DB stops .
thus, enabling ths usage cost of resources when traffic is inconsistent.
